# K-means-Strategy
K-means_algortihm_Strategy Part 1 (K-mean) Overview:
In Part 1, you are required to implement the following strategy for choosing the initial cluster centers. 

Part 1 is to randomly pick the initial centers from the given samples.   

You need to test your implementation on the given data, with the number k of clusters ranging from 2-10, output the final coordinate of the centroids and compute the loss based on the objective function. 

K-means_algortihm_Strategy2 (K-mean ++) Overview:
In Part 2, you are required to implement the following strategy for choosing the initial cluster centers.

 Part 2 is to pick the first center randomly; for the ii-th center (ii>1), choose a sample (among all possible samples) such that the average distance of this chosen one to all previous (ii-1) centers is maximal. 

You need to test your implementation on the given data, with the number k of clusters ranging from 2-10, output the final coordinate of the centroids and compute the loss based on the objective function.

# K-means-Strategy
K-means_algortihm_Strategy Part 1 (K-mean) Overview:
In Part 1, you are required to implement the following strategy for choosing the initial cluster centers. 

Part 1 is to randomly pick the initial centers from the given samples.   

You need to test your implementation on the given data, with the number k of clusters ranging from 2-10, output the final coordinate of the centroids and compute the loss based on the objective function.
